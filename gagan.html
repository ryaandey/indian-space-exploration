        <p>Gaganyaan is India’s first planned human spaceflight mission, developed by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO). <br> It aims to send Indian astronauts, or "vyomanauts," into low Earth orbit, marking a major milestone in India's space program.<br><br>
            <H2>Key Facts:</h2>
            
           <p> <strong>Mission Objective:</strong> The goal of Gaganyaan is to demonstrate India’s capability for human spaceflight by launching astronauts into space and safely returning them to Earth. <br> This includes testing life-support systems, spacecraft design, and mission planning.<br><br>

            <strong>Mission Timeline:</strong> Originally scheduled for 2022, the mission timeline has been adjusted to ensure safety and precision, with unmanned test missions planned before the crewed flight.<br><br>
            
            <strong>Spacecraft Design:</strong> The Gaganyaan spacecraft includes a crew module for astronauts and a service module for propulsion and life-support systems. <br> It is designed to carry a crew of up to three astronauts for a mission lasting approximately 5 to 7 days.<br><br>
            
            <strong>Training and Collaboration:</strong> ISRO has partnered with Russia for astronaut training, with selected Indian astronauts undergoing extensive training in Russia and India to prepare for the mission.<br><br>

            <h2>Significance:</h2>
            <p>Gaganyaan will make India the fourth country to send humans into space, joining the ranks of the United States, Russia, and China. <br> This mission will enhance India's capabilities in human spaceflight and open doors for future manned missions, including potential missions to the Moon.</p>
