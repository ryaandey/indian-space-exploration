        <p>Aryabhata was India’s first satellite, launched on April 19, 1975. <br> Named after the ancient Indian mathematician and astronomer Aryabhata, this landmark mission marked India’s entry into the field of space exploration and satellite technology.<br><br>
            
            <H2>Key Features and Achievements:</h2>
            
           <p> <strong>Launch Vehicle:</strong> Aryabhata was launched by the Soviet Union using a Kosmos-3M launch vehicle from the Sriharikota Range in India.<br><br>
            <strong>Purpose:</strong> The primary mission of Aryabhata was to conduct scientific experiments in areas such as astronomy, atmospheric studies, and solar physics. It was equipped with instruments to measure cosmic rays and perform experiments in X-ray astronomy.<br><br>
            <strong>Design and Structure:</strong> The satellite weighed about 360 kilograms and was shaped like a cube. It had a rigid structure and was designed to operate in a low Earth orbit.<br><br>
            <strong>Significance:</strong> The launch of Aryabhata was a significant milestone for India, showcasing the country's capabilities in space technology and satellite development. It laid the foundation for future Indian space missions and contributed to advancements in communication, meteorology, and earth observation.</p>
            <br><br>
            <p>Despite experiencing some technical challenges after its launch, Aryabhata's successful deployment marked the beginning of India's ambitious journey in space exploration, ultimately leading to the establishment of the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and a series of successful satellite launches and interplanetary missions in the years that followed.</p>
