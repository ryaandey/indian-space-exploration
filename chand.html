        <p>Chandrayaan is India’s series of lunar exploration missions developed by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO). <br> The program aims to explore the Moon's surface and gather valuable scientific data.<br><br>
            

            <h2>Key Missions:</h2>
            <p>

                - <strong>Chandrayaan-1:</strong> Launched on October 22, 2008, it was India's first mission to the Moon. <br> Chandrayaan-1 successfully orbited the Moon and made significant discoveries, including the presence of water molecules on the lunar surface.<br><br>
                
                - <strong>Chandrayaan-2:</strong> Launched on July 22, 2019, this mission included an orbiter, a lander (Vikram), and a rover (Pragyan). <br> While the orbiter continues to study the Moon from above, the lander unfortunately lost communication during its descent.<br><br>
                
                - <strong>Chandrayaan-3:</strong> Launched on July 14, 2023, this mission aimed to achieve a soft landing on the Moon. <br> Chandrayaan-3 successfully landed on August 23, 2023, near the lunar south pole, making India the fourth country to achieve this feat.<br><br></p>
            
                <H2>Significance:</h2>
            
           <p> The Chandrayaan missions have significantly advanced lunar science and increased our understanding of the Moon’s geology and environment. <br> These missions have also enhanced India’s reputation in the global space community and paved the way for future explorations, including potential manned missions to the Moon.
