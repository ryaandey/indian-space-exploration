        <p>Indian space exploration has grown from humble beginnings to an inspiring journey marked by remarkable achievements. <br> Managed by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), India's space program began in 1962 with a mission to use space technology for national development. <br> Over the years, it has evolved to achieve world-class milestones, showcasing the country’s prowess in science and engineering. <br><br> Starting with the launch of its first satellite, Aryabhata, in 1975, ISRO has continuously expanded its capabilities. <br> India’s space program has achieved a reputation for innovative, cost-effective space missions, becoming the first nation to reach Mars on its maiden attempt with the Mars Orbiter Mission (Mangalyaan) in 2014. <br> Additionally, ISRO’s Chandrayaan missions have contributed valuable insights about the Moon, and Chandrayaan-3 recently achieved a historic soft landing near the lunar south pole in 2023, making India the fourth country in the world to achieve this feat. <br><br> Today, India is also exploring planetary missions, human spaceflight programs (Gaganyaan), and ambitious plans for interplanetary exploration. <br> By combining indigenous research with collaborative international efforts, Indian space exploration continues to inspire and propel the nation toward new frontiers in space science and discovery.
