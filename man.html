        <p>Mangalyaan, also known as the Mars Orbiter Mission (MOM), is India's first interplanetary mission, launched by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO). <br> It marked India’s entry into deep space exploration and showcased its ability to carry out complex space missions on a modest budget. <br><br>
            
            <H2>Key Facts:</h2>
            
           <p> <strong>Launch Date:</strong> Mangalyaan was launched on November 5, 2013, using the PSLV-C25 launch vehicle.<br><br>

            <strong>Objective:</strong> The mission aimed to explore Mars’ surface, morphology, atmosphere, and mineralogy from orbit. <br> It also sought to demonstrate India’s capability for interplanetary exploration.<br><br>
            
            <strong>Historic Achievement:</strong> On September 24, 2014, Mangalyaan successfully entered Mars orbit on its first attempt. <br> This made India the first country to reach Mars on its maiden mission and the fourth space agency globally to do so.<br><br>
            
            <strong>Cost-Effectiveness:</strong> Mangalyaan is known for its remarkable cost-effectiveness, with a mission budget of approximately $74 million, one of the lowest for a Mars mission.<br><br>

            <h2>Significance:</h2>
            <p>Mangalyaan has provided valuable data on Mars’ surface features, atmospheric conditions, and mineral composition. <br> The mission's success showcased ISRO’s growing capabilities in space science and established India as a key player in planetary exploration.</p>
